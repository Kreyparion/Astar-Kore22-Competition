# Early game
## Use opponents mistakes
-> intercept lonly ships

-> overtake the oponents shipyar for 1 turn if it's unprotected

## Optimised mining
---> Calculate the purcentage of 8, 21 and more with the repartition of the kores on the map

-> [[Mine with 8|Use 8]] to mine surroundings kore
-> [[Mine with 21|Use 21]] to mine the kores that are a little bit far away
-> [[Mine with big ships|Use big ships]] to mine the central Kore (try not to unprotect the shipyard)

# Middle Game

## Prepare for battle
-> Regroup all the ships without summoning new ones for a special action

### Attack with a lot of ships
- Focus the attack on the shipyard with the most spawn_power to cut the respawn off
- Deny some kore from the ships that are going home ?
- Use the ships that are left to attack an other shipyard
- Try to end the game fast if you have ship supremacy

### Defend the shipyard
- if the opponent is sending a ship to attack, regroup before it arrives
- Quick mine and spawn to have the maximum ships to protect the shipyard


## Targeted attacks
- Try to attack a group of ships doing grouped damages
- Try to attack an enemy ship that has/is going to mine a lot of Kore (with a good strength in a danger zone)


## Build new shipyard
-> if you have ship supremacy and don't let the other shipyard defenceless

### Build a replacement shipyard 
-> Build a shipyard very close to the other one and manage the ship launching/catching from the new shipyard to let the old one spawn new ships at full capacity

### Build a mining shipyard
-> Get the shipyard close to other kores to mine efficiently from it

### Build an outpost shipyard
-> Get the shipyard close to the enemy lines to reduce the space controlled by the enemy
-> Be sure to denfend it well


/!\ Always take care of the difference of the number of ships between you and your opponent
-> It impacts the build of a new shipyard
-> It can push an attack to end the game fast


/!\ Always take care of the number of ships at all instant in your opponent shipyard
-> Try to match it with the nearest shipyard so that if he tries an attack, you can defend against it or also counter-attack
